1
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,291
Darkest Peru.

2
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,611
A vast, unexplored wilderness shrouded in mystery. Until now!

3
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,766
For I have been charged by my fellow geographers

4
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,127
to leave the comforts of home and family

5
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,568
and set off upon a voyage of discovery.

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,166
I travel light, carrying only the absolute essentials.

7
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,244
Maps, rations, modest timepiece and travel piano.

8
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,361
And finally, deep in the undergrowth, I spot something extraordinary.

9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,569
An undiscovered species of bear.

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,450
Time to collect a specimen for the museum.

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,403
I thought my time was up, my ticket was punched.

12
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,647
But the bear saved my life.

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,803
He guided me through the jungle to show me his world,

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,089
and in return, I introduced him to ours.

15
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,290
That's, erm... That's a telescope. That's my grandfather's telescope.

16
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,451
Oh, be very careful with that.

17
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,683
That's soap. Really wouldn't eat that.

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,209
Here we are, why don't you try this? This is marmalade.

19
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,568
You spread it on toast, put it in sandwiches, or...

20
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,928
Or you can drink it. Jolly good.

21
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,203
This is London. That's where I'm from.

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,521
Lon-don.

23
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,447
Good Lord!

24
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,841
Now try Stratford-upon-Avon.

25
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,163
Over time, I become friends with the bears and even name them.

26
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,846
The female after my dear departed mother

27
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,242
and the male after an exotic boxer I once met in a bar.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,364
But the time eventually comes to return to my wife and daughter

29
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,249
and share my findings with the world.

30
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,051
Goodbye, Lucy. Goodbye, Pastuzo.

31
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,688
And if you ever make it to London, you can be sure of a very warm welcome.

32
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,603
I have learnt so much from these bears

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,129
but I wonder what, if anything, they have learnt from me.

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,647
Marmalade!

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,286
They're ripe. They're ripe. They're finally ripe!

36
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,245
Aunt Lucy!

37
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,169
Uncle Pastuzo!

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,289
You're never going to guess... Whoa!

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,689
Good morning, Aunt Lucy.

40
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,728
Good morning, my little hurricane.

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,044
Why do you have to come crashing in here like a natural disaster?

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,567
But, Uncle Pastuzo... they're ripe.

43
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,245
Whoa-ho-ho!

44
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,163
It's Marmalade Day!

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,844
Marmalade Day!

46
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,926
Oh, it rather suits me. Marmalade Day!

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,171
Oh, do calm down, you two.

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,447
There's no need to rush.

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,162
Now be careful up there.

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,284
And keep your paws off my hat.

51
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,850
I will.

52
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,965
Marmalade.

53
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,363
Just one sandwich contains all the vitamins and minerals

54
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,204
a bear needs for a whole day.

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,408
- Amazing. - Hmm.

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,883
And your Aunt Lucy's recipe is even better than the explorer's.

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,089
We must remember to take him a jar when we go to London.

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,491
London?

59
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,929
I wouldn't worry! We've been talking about that trip for 40 years.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,968
One day, Pastuzo.

61
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,849
But why would you want to go anywhere

62
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,922
when we live in the best place in the world?

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,810
Whoa!

64
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,927
Whoo-hoo!

65
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,201
Goodness.

66
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,486
I thought I told you to be careful.

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,005
And give me back my hat.

68
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,162
- Yes, Uncle. But... - No buts.

69
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,608
It's about time I got a bit of respect around here.

70
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,490
Embarrassing.

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,761
But tasty.

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,644
Friendly advice for the foreigner in London. Lesson three.

73
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,122
It's dusk, and you pass a stranger in the street.

74
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,402
- Greet them politely.- Good evening.

75
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,324
To take the conversation further, talk about the weather.

76
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,482
Real brolly-buster, isn't it?

77
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,610
Fact: Londoners have 101 ways to say that it is raining...

78
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,287
- Can I have the last sandwich? - Oh, no, I need that.

79
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,409
A wise bear always keeps a marmalade sandwich in his hat

80
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,369
in case of emergency.

81
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,408
...and it's bucketing down.

82
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,088
Follow these simple rules and you will always feel at home in London.

83
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,402
- Aunt Lucy? - Earthquake!

84
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,963
Get to the shelter!

85
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,965
Oh!

86
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,441
- Aunt Lucy! - Keep going!

87
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,845
Are you alright?

88
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,567
Uncle Pastuzo!

89
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,807
Uncle Pastuzo!

90
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,806
Get down!

91
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,484
Uncle Pastuzo?

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,051
Pastuzo?

93
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,842
Uncle Pastuzo?

94
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,767
Aunt Lucy.

95
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,042
What are we going to do?

96
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,161
Stay out of sight until London.

97
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,081
But... aren't you coming?

98
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,960
I am too old and too tired to go any further.

99
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,964
Oh. Then, what will you do?

100
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,362
Oh, don't you worry about me.

101
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,689
I will be safe in the home for retired bears.

102
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,651
But it is not yet time for you to retire.

103
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,281
You must find a new home. In London.

104
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,366
But... But I don't know anyone there. What if they don't even like bears?

105
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,326
You know, there was once a war in the explorer's country.

106
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,086
Thousands of children were sent away for safety,

107
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,006
left at railway stations with labels around their necks,

108
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,530
and unknown families took them in and loved them like their own.

109
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,966
They will not have forgotten how to treat a stranger.

110
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,845
Now take care, my darling. Remember your manners.

111
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,243
And keep safe.

112
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,927
Hmm?

113
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,411
Oh.

114
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,123
Huh?

115
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,442
OK, I'll just get it now.

116
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,884
I'll throw it down.

117
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,010
Hi.

118
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,445
London.

119
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,971
Oh, right. Yes. Manners. Here goes.

120
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,323
Good morning. Really tipping it down, isn't it?

121
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,731
Strange.

122
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,246
How do you do? I'm just looking for a home. And I...

123
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,811
Hello?

124
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,325
Excuse me...

125
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,084
Does anyone know where I... where I can find a home?

126
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,241
Anyone?

127
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,044
Passengers are reminded to keep their belongings with them at all times.

128
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,682
Unattended items will be taken away and could be destroyed.

129
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh, dear.

130
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,889
Oh, hello.

131
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,081
You hungry?

132
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,366
Me, too.

133
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,207
But this is all I've got left. It's really just for emergency.

134
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,724
Oh, go on then.

135
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,802
Ah, right, I see what I've done.

136
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,327
Erm, come on, you can't all be having emergencies.

137
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,162
Can you all just go away, please? I need to look presentable.

138
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,210
- That was so boring. - I'm sorry you feel like that,

139
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,722
but it was my week to choose and I enjoyed the Victorian Wool Experience.

140
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,848
At least we spent time together as a family.

141
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,730
- And we learnt a lot about wool. - Did you have fun, pumpkin?

142
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,644
It's Judy, and it was fine until you jumped in the lake.

143
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,690
It's a bathing pond. It's what you're supposed to do.

144
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,445
- Not naked! - Well, I forgot my costume.

145
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,409
Jonathan, don't jump like that.

146
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,290
Seven per cent of childhood accidents start with jumping.

147
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,045
- If I'm gonna be an astronaut... - You're not gonna be.

148
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,043
You can be whatever you want, peanut.

149
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,963
- Oh, stranger danger. - What?

150
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,884
Keep your eyes down. There's some sort of bear over there.

151
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,247
- Probably selling something. - Good evening.

152
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,163
No, thank you.

153
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,526
Oh, dear.

154
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,362
Must be doing something wrong.

155
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,411
Hello there.

156
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,766
Mary!

157
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,407
Oh. Hello.

158
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,927
Coming down in stair rods, isn't it?

159
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,331
Oh...

160
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,206
Yes.

161
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,850
- Mum... - Er...

162
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,521
I hope you don't mind me asking, but shouldn't you be at home?

163
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,766
Oh, yes, I should. But... I haven't quite worked out how to find one.

164
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,923
- Where are your parents? - They died when I was small.

165
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,651
- Here we go. - All I have left is my aunt.

166
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,489
- And where's she? - Darkest Peru.

167
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,166
- In the home for retired bears. - Yeah, course she is.

168
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,765
How did you get here?

169
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,808
- I stowed away. In a lifeboat. - Cool!

170
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,565
And ate marmalade. Did you know bears like marmalade?

171
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,007
I didn't even know bears could talk.

172
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,730
Well, I'm a very rare bear.

173
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,962
There aren't many of us left.

174
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,485
And what are you going to do now?

175
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,451
Well, I thought I would probably just sleep over there in that bin.

176
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,443
That's the spirit. Anyway...

177
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,171
- Dad! - Why don't we find you some help?

178
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,245
Oh, yes, please. If you're sure it's no trouble?

179
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,005
Of course it isn't. Is it, darling?

180
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,089
Not at all.

181
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,850
- Oh, yes, that is good. - So, erm...

182
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,684
- What's your name? - Hmm?

183
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,206
- Do bears even have names? - Of course we do.

184
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,806
My name is...

185
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,121
Beg your pardon?

186
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,566
Right.

187
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,010
- Well, go on. - Hmm?

188
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,003
You try it.

189
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,048
Back of the throat.

190
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,566
Mr. Brown, that is extremely rude.

191
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,005
Oh, at last.

192
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,684
Oh. Er, wait for me.

193
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,683
Is someone coming to get him?

194
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,888
Everyone's gone. He'll have to come with us.

195
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,325
- No way. - Dad!

196
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,846
- Stay where you are. - He's so embarrassing.

197
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,405
We can't leave him here.

198
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,290
We can. He's not our responsibility.

199
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,931
He's a young bear who needs our help, Henry.

200
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,329
It's just for one night, until we can find the right people to look after him.

201
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,164
There you are.

202
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,730
- OK. - Yes!

203
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,041
- Excuse me? Erm... - Hello.

204
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,044
I'm dreadfully sorry, I don't actually know your name.

205
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,920
Well, I've got a bear name, but it seems to be rather hard to pronounce.

206
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,047
That's not ripe.

207
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,331
- Perhaps you'd like an English name. - An English name? Like what?

208
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,167
Oh, look, Henry, it's perfect.

209
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,130
You want to call him Ketchup? Ketchup the bear?

210
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,362
- Paddington! - Paddington?

211
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,010
Paddington.

212
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,921
Pa-dding-ton.

213
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,684
Paddington!

214
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,762
Sorry! I like it.

215
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,723
Well, then, Paddington, how would you like to come home with us?

216
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,130
♪ London is the place for me

217
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,968
♪ London, that lovely city

218
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,168
♪ You could go to France or America

219
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,447
♪ India, Asia or Australia

220
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,928
♪ You're gonna come back to London City

221
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,922
♪ London is the place for me

222
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,447
Oh! What sort of route do you call that?

223
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,604
Well, the young bear said it was his first time in London.

224
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,330
I thought I'd show him the sights.

225
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,602
- Should've charged morel - Keep the change.

226
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,001
Cheer up, mate. Might never happen.

227
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,162
Darling, have you got your keys?

228
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,802
Come on, Paddington.

229
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,209
Oh, yes.

230
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,529
But this... this is wonderful!

231
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,487
Do you know, I was actually beginning to think

232
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,769
nobody would give me a home, but this...! That's ripe.

233
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,650
This will suit me down to the ground. Thank you very much.

234
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,849
Er... we're not giving you a home.

235
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,888
- Oh? - It's just for the night.

236
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,087
Oh.

237
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,322
When a young person comes to this country,

238
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,529
I'm afraid they don't just move in with the first people they meet.

239
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,921
- No? - You need a proper guardian.

240
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,047
What's that?

241
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,124
A grown-up who takes you into their home and looks after you.

242
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,440
Like you?

243
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,849
Erm... Yes, well, I suppose so.

244
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,763
But not you?

245
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,130
No. We don't do that.

246
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,921
- It's normally someone you know. - But what if you don't know anybody?

247
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,961
In that case, the authorities will house you in some kind of government facility.

248
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,883
What? Like an orphanage?

249
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,248
No, no, no, not an orphanage.

250
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,530
It would be more like an institution for young souls

251
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,049
whose parents have sadly passed on.

252
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,689
Oh.

253
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,849
- Well, what about the explorer? - Who?

254
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,322
The man who visited us in Darkest Peru. He said we'd always be welcome.

255
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,802
Well, what's his name? You could go now.

256
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,008
Ooh, well, I don't know his human name.

257
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,651
My uncle and aunt hadn't learnt much English back then,

258
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,121
so they always called him...

259
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,443
There can't be that many explorers who've been to Peru.

260
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,851
Maybe we can find him.

261
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,127
Without a name? I wouldn't get your hopes up.

262
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,204
Right, come on, you. Pyjamas.

263
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,481
Jonathan!

264
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,168
Walk.

265
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,606
Don't worry, Paddington.

266
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,728
- We'll find him. - Oh, thank you.

267
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,524
Let's look in the encyclopaedia,

268
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,285
unless, of course, you'd like to freshen up first.

269
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,930
I beg your pardon?

270
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,608
You know, use the facilities? Most people do after a long journey.

271
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,368
Oh. Well, if that's what most people do, then I'd like to do that.

272
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,845
- Top of the stairs. - Top of the... Ah, stairs.

273
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,011
OK. You're going that way. Got it.

274
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,682
- Are you alright? - All good.

275
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,650
Hello. This is Henry Brown.32 Windsor Gardens.

276
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,082
I just need to add something to my home insurance policy.

277
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,003
Well, what it is, is we have a guest for the night, a bear,

278
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,971
and I just needed some extra cover for any da... Yes, a bear.

279
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,371
No, a real one.

280
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,408
About three foot six.

281
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,043
Grizzly? Not particularly.

282
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,726
Mind you, I haven't seen him in the mornings.

283
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,081
So, how much would that be?

284
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,881
Batten down the hatches, young 'un. There'll be a storm tonight.

285
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,644
The radio said it was clearing up.

286
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,929
Radio! I feel it in my knees. My knees never lie.

287
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,685
- Guess what, Mrs. Bird! We found a bear! - Uh-huh.

288
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,610
- A real bear from Peru! - That's nice, dear.

289
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,284
You don't seem very surprised.

290
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,728
I gave up being surprised when they came up with the microwave oven.

291
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,490
And I still don't trust you.

292
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,646
Hmm...

293
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,361
Hmm?

294
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,686
Thank you for holding. Your call is...

295
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,445
- ..moderately... - ..important to us.

296
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,041
Help.

297
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,520
- Where's he going to sleep? - Not in my room. He's a he.

298
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,602
- Tony's a he. - Shut up.

299
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,121
And Tony would be more than welcome to a bunk-up.

300
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,770
- Who's Tony? - I'm warning you.

301
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,242
- Just some boy she's in love with. - No? Darling, really?

302
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,800
- That's it! - When can I meet him?

303
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,524
Can I meet him? Darling?

304
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,169
- He can sleep in my room. - He's not sleeping in anyone's room.

305
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,766
He's going in the attic. I want you all to lock your doors.

306
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,525
I can't find anything about an English explorer in Peru.

307
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,648
- Of course you can't. - Why not?

308
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,486
He's making the whole thing up. It's the sort of sob story your mother falls for.

309
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,881
- Hang on. That's not fair. - It so is fair.

310
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,645
You've literally just brought home a random bear.

311
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,366
- So embarrassing. - You'd have done the same thing.

312
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,807
We're much more similar than you think.

313
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,770
- What are you doing? - The storm is upon us.

314
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,322
Oh, you and your knees. I can tell you for a fact, Mrs. Bird,

315
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,164
it is not going to rain indoors.

316
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,327
- Oh, no. - There she blows.

317
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,044
- Mr. Brown, are you there? - Yes, hello.

318
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,889
Yes, that sounds fine.

319
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,606
No, no, no, don't read me the terms and conditions.

320
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,288
I want to action this as soon as possible. Don't put me on hold again!

321
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,806
Paddington? What is going on in there?

322
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,881
Er, nothing. I'm just having a spot of bother with the facilities.

323
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,808
Erm... Nice weather for the ducks?

324
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,042
Oh.

325
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,202
That was amazing.

326
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,801
Dear Aunt Lucy. I have arrived in London

327
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,250
and so far it has rained, poured, drizzled and chucked it down.

328
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,763
And I miss you.

329
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,489
London is not how we imagined it.

330
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,564
Hardly anyone says hello or wears hats.

331
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,362
And you can no longer simply turn up at the station and get a home.

332
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,761
It's hard to see where a bear could ever belong

333
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,605
in such a strange, cold city.

334
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,531
Luckily, I met the Browns, who are letting me sleep in their attic.

335
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,082
They have a lovely house, but I'm not going to be allowed to stay.

336
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,970
That animal is going straight to the authorities.

337
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,123
- What about the explorer? - There is no explorer.

338
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,841
I'm not putting this family in danger while you go on some wild-goose chase.

339
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,810
First thing tomorrow, that bear is out of here.

340
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,327
The Browns are a very curious tribe.

341
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,131
Mr. Brown is something called a risk analyst.

342
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,888
He says that having a bear in the house increases the chances of major disaster

343
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,644
by 4,000%.

344
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,529
Mrs. Brown illustrates adventure stories.

345
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,446
Her latest is set in the old tunnels and sewers under London.

346
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,204
She says she's stuck at the moment

347
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,090
because she can't imagine what her hero looks like,

348
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,403
but has no trouble coming up with nicknames for her daughter Judy,

349
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,405
- like twinkle and coconut and...- Sweety pops? Hello, darling.

350
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,086
I was thinking of going to the sewers tomorrow night.

351
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,121
I just wondered if you wanted to join me. You could bring this Tony.

352
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,411
Why would I want to bring anyone down the toilet?

353
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,329
Come on, darling, it's not like that.

354
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,530
It's a subterranean labyrinth that can take you anywhere in the city.

355
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,046
It's weird, it smells and it's embarrassing.

356
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,367
Sure. Good point.

357
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,966
Judy suffers from a serious condition

358
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,485
called embarrassment.

359
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,689
She is seeing a boy called Tony but won't bring him home.

360
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,084
- So, when can I come round your house? - That's never gonna happen.

361
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,565
She is learning Chinese...

362
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,201
Could you tell me the way to the central business district?

363
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,367
..so she can run away and start a small business.

364
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,602
I have been accused of insider trading

365
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,326
and require legal representation.

366
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,722
When Jonathan grows up, he wants to be an astronaut.

367
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,246
Last year he built a pair of rocket boots...

368
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,766
Three, two, one.

369
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,004
...and is now only allowed to play

370
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,290
with safe, educational, indoor toys from the olden days.

371
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,802
They live with an old relative called Mrs. Bird.

372
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,601
Her husband was in the Navy, and she still likes everything shipshape.

373
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,689
Tomorrow, they are taking me to the authorities,

374
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,003
who will house me in something that is not an orphanage,

375
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,449
but still doesn't sound like the sort of home we were really hoping for.

376
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,480
Can't you sleep?

377
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,485
Me neither.

378
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,490
I do wish we could have found the explorer.

379
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,530
I know, Paddington. But I've been looking everywhere

380
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,922
and I still can't find any mention of an English expedition to Peru.

381
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,324
But there really was an explorer, Mrs. Brown. He gave my uncle this hat.

382
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,562
What, that was the explorer's hat?

383
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,642
Hm-hmm. Why?

384
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,002
I've got a friend who runs an antiques shop in the Portobello Road.

385
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,208
He knows all about old things like your hat.

386
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,406
Oh...

387
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,165
It's just possible he could help us find your explorer.

388
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,969
Well, that would be wonderful.

389
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,442
- But didn't Mr. Brown say... - Don't you worry about Mr. Brown.

390
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,649
As far as he's concerned, we're going to the authorities.

391
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,281
But I'm not standing by while there's a chance of finding you a proper home.

392
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,802
Now make sure you get some sleep, OK?

393
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,885
Night-night.

394
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,449
Tomorrow, we are going to find the explorer.

395
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,329
Love from Paddington.

396
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,481
Oh.

397
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,404
PS. That is now my name.

398
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,164
Good evening, Grant.

399
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,130
Madam Director.

400
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,041
Another delivery from the docks?

401
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,326
Bring it through.

402
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,725
Yes!

403
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,408
You are going to make a fantastic addition to the collection.

404
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,886
Aren't you worried people will ask questions?

405
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,601
Not at all. As far as the tree-huggers who run this place are concerned,

406
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,889
I'd never dream of stuffing a poor defenceless animal.

407
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,000
However, it's not enough for me just to look after this dusty old collection.

408
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,289
I need to add the odd choice specimen of my own.

409
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,606
There was some weird sort of animal at the dock today.

410
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,125
Oh, yes?

411
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,283
Yeah. I was doing my rounds as usual

412
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,244
when I spotted something sticky on the deck of the boat.

413
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,248
I think they were paw prints.

414
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,044
Whatever it was that had made them

415
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,202
had hidden himself away in the lifeboat.

416
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,485
Must have been in there all the way from Peru.

417
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,801
Seems to have lived on nothing but marmalade.

418
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,083
Did you say marmalade?

419
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,362
- Hmm. - What happened to him?

420
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,488
- He sneaked out in the mail van. - Yes?

421
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,403
- I tracked him to Paddington. - Good.

422
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,766
But then he disappeared.

423
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,042
I'm sorry. It's just that that creature means a great deal to me.

424
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,407
Why? Is he endangered?

425
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,970
He is now.

426
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,126
Oof!

427
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,601
Now, I know you all like marmalade, but this is my sandwich.

428
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:44,166
Erm, you're not using those ear brushes to clean your mouth, are you, Mr. Brown?

429
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,969
Peculiar habit.

430
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,166
Morning!

431
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,365
Awesome.

432
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,687
Jonathan. Don't even think about it.

433
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,604
34 per cent of pre-breakfast accidents involve banisters.

434
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,286
- But Paddington... - I don't care what Paddington...

435
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,923
Whoa.

436
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,170
- It's so annoying, Mum. - What is, pumpkin?

437
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,844
All my bathroom stuff is ruined.

438
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,123
Well, I've never liked you using harsh chemicals, darling.

439
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,202
They play havoc on people's skin.

440
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,368
- Morning, Judy. - Hello.

441
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,402
- Why is Dad so boring and annoying? - It's for your own good.

442
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,885
Be nice, darlings.

443
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,769
All I was trying to do was wash my face.

444
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,126
Oh.

445
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,891
Better?

446
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,930
Come on, you two, or you'll be late for school.

447
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,321
Heck of a racket coming from your way last night, Brown.

448
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,727
Hello, Mr. Curry. I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

449
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,881
Good morning.

450
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,922
- I don't believe I've had the pleasure. - Mr. Curry, this is Paddington.

451
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,771
- He's a bear. - I can see that.

452
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,208
- You must be a long way from home. - I'm from Darkest Peru.

453
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,365
- Oh. - Don't worry, Mr. Curry, he's going.

454
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,449
Just as well. Don't want to be kept up by any of your loud jungle music.

455
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,121
Don't tell anyone at school about Paddington.

456
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,361
Why not?

457
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,689
Because everyone thinks we're weird enough without the bear.

Hello there.

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,449
Ooh! Dog!

463
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,607
Where's that bear? Now, watch out. There are thieves, murderers

464
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,251
and pickpockets on every platform. So follow us

465
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,402
- and do exactly as you're told. - Right-o.

466
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,360
Ah. Thank you.

467
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,606
Officer.

468
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,921
Hmm.

469
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,969
So, about the authorities. I've printed off directions.

470
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,246
Oh. Laminated.

471
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,891
- The green arrows are to make... - Thank you, darling.

472
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,485
I know exactly where I'm going.

473
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,887
- Where's Paddington? - What?

474
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,766
Oh! Paddington.

475
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,251
Paddington!

476
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,525
Hmm...

477
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,921
Oh!

478
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,727
Hmm!

Paddington!

488
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,166
- Over here! - Coming.

489
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,330
That one's mine, thank you.

490
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,050
I assume he's yours.

491
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,444
Tell you what, Paddington.

492
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,491
It's not far to my friend's antiques shop. Why don't we walk?

493
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,968
- Ah, Mrs. Brown. Come in. - You must be Mr. Gruber.

494
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,931
And you must be the young gentleman whose hat sounds so fascinating.

495
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,401
Welcome. You're just in time for elevenses.

496
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,770
Every morning it arrives at 11 o'clock,

497
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,002
bringing salvation.

498
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,368
Just like a train that I took many years ago.

499
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,920
- Really? - Oh, yes. You see,

500
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,685
there was a lot of trouble in my country.

501
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,322
So my parents sent me all the way across Europe,

502
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,483
when I was not much older than you are now.

503
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,648
Was it hard to find a home?

504
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,001
I had a great-aunt who took me in.

505
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,250
Master Gruber?

506
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,528
But I soon learnt a home is more than a roof over your head.

507
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,530
My body had travelled very fast but my heart...

508
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,530
...she took a little longer to arrive.

509
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,686
Hmm.

510
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,246
But now I should like to take a look at your hat.

511
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,005
- Oh, thank you. - Unusual colour.

512
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,290
But it is hard to say how much of that is original and how much...

513
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,805
Marmalade?

514
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,406
My uncle always kept a marmalade sandwich in his hat

515
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,050
in case of emergency.

516
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,250
You're pulling my legs off. What a splendid idea.

517
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,324
Ooh. Now, if you look carefully,

518
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,687
you can see your hat has been hand stitched,

519
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,962
which suggests it is one of a kind.

520
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,405
- Really? - Yes.

521
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,561
Hello there.

522
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,687
- Oh, wait a minute. - It's very subtle.

523
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,610
- Oh, Paddington! - The gentleman dropped his wallet!

524
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,165
Where is he?

525
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,203
- Mind out! - Stop!

526
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,164
Come back!

527
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,485
What's he doing?

528
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,481
- Excuse me. Coming through. - Careful!

529
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,722
Just trying to return some lost property.

530
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,444
Hey, what are you doing?

531
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,920
Whoa!

532
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,128
Sorry!

533
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,488
Oi, come back!

534
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,891
Some kind of tiny police bear.

535
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,128
You!

536
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,440
What are you doing?

537
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,251
Trying to return some lost property.

538
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,529
Get away from here! Leave my dog alone!

539
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,520
Do you want a biscuit?

540
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:37,764
Charlie Delta. Officer in distress. Urgent assistance required. Go, go, go.

541
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,766
In 100 yards, bear left.

542
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,247
I've got your wallet!

543
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,881
Whoo-hoo!

544
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,486
It's actually quite good fun. Ah.

545
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,124
The Winter's Tale

546
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,244
contains Shakespeare's most famous stage direction:

547
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,449
- Exit, pursued by a... - Paddington?

548
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,921
- Paddington? - Look, a bear!

549
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,648
You... dropped your wallet.

550
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,122
Gosh, you've got quite a few.

551
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,490
He certainly has.

552
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:43,287
No, you don't understand. I was just trying to return some lost property.

553
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,323
Oh, hello, Judy.

554
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,847
- Do you know that bear? - Erm...

555
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,251
He's awesome.

556
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,731
- Yeah, he's called Paddington. - Thank you.

557
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,371
Thank you.

558
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,442
- Well done. - Bear of the moment!

559
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,569
Oh, really? I just did what any bear would do.

560
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,085
I can't thank you enough.

561
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,006
That scoundrel has been pocket-picketing people around here for weeks.

562
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,491
He was extraordinary.

563
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,404
And it gave me a chance to look at his hat.

564
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,165
- You see, this is no ordinary hat. - No?

565
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,122
No. These markings mean that it was made for a member of the Geographers' Guild.

566
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,406
What's that?

567
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,761
A very old explorers' club.

568
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,763
- Oh! - Go and see them in the morning,

569
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,366
and if luck has been smiling on your face,

570
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,125
they should be able to tell you who they made it for.

571
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,320
OK. Protein.

572
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,368
- Per biscuit? - Per biscuit.

573
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,649
- 0.5 grams. - Yes.

574
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,642
Carbohydrates.

575
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,290
- Per biscuit? - Per biscuit.

576
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,126
- Is 7.7 grams. - Yes.

577
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,689
- Sodium. - Ooh...

578
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,161
- I know this one. - Yeah. Do you?

579
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,447
- Is it trace? - Not trace.

580
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,771
It's him! After all these years, it's really him!

581
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,366
You're stuffed, bear.

582
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,848
- One night, you said. One night! - I know...

583
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,207
You promised to take him to the authorities.

584
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,090
- I never promised. - Well, you very heavily implied it.

585
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,245
I'm sorry, but he was telling the truth. There really is an explorer.

586
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,286
- What are you doing? - I'm doing my looking-away face.

587
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,840
- Are you doing the breathing? - I'm doing the breathing.

588
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,730
All we need to do is take him to the Geographers' Guild.

589
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,245
- Stop! - The hand's gone up.

590
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,284
- We've done quite enough for this bear. - And the voice.

591
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,250
- I am taking charge! - You're taking charge?

592
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,800
Yes! Paddington is a danger to this family.

593
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,167
Jonathan is quite irresponsible enough

594
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,005
without throwing a wild animal into the mix.

595
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,084
Hey, Paddington. Have you seen the paper?

596
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,281
Gosh.

597
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,250
You've only been in London a day and you're already famous.

598
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,004
Oh.

599
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,771
I'm sorry if I wasn't very nice before.

600
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:22,402
It's just it's a new school and I didn't want everyone to think I was weird.

601
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,280
Oh, I understand, Judy. It's not easy being somewhere new.

602
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,164
No, it isn't.

603
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,402
He put earwax on my toothbrush!

604
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,531
Things can be very different from how you imagined.

605
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:38,127
Don't let him bother you. Dad's always been boring and annoying.

606
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,642
Oh, I don't know about that. More to your father than meets the eye.

607
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,482
- Like what? - When I first met him,

608
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,483
he was a very different man.

Doesn't it rain enough in this city without having showers in the house?

634
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,602
The point is, we are parents now and we have to protect our children.

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,922
Ah, there it is.

643
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,889
- That's my old duffle coat. - Actually, it was mine first.

644
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,128
Well, long before that, it was mine.

- Oh, was it, Mr. Brown? - Really?

646
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,842
- He wore it on his first day at school. - It's lovely.

647
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,526
Wooden buttons for ease of paw.

648
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,490
And these two sandwich compartments are an excellent idea.

649
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,722
I must say, it suits you very well.

650
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,280
I never thought I'd like a human coat, but...

You look like one of the family.

00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,643
You're not going to send Paddington to the authorities, are you?

653
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,408
You will try the Geographers' Guild?

654
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,411
Yes, alright, we'll see if they know anything.

655
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,211
- But if it's a dead end... - I'm sure it won't be.

Thank you very much, Mr. Brown.

657
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,122
You must get a lot of strange customers in here.

00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,043
You don't know the half of it, love.

659
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,881
I've had bishops, magicians, bears, contortionists.

660

Did you say bears?

661
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,768
Yeah. Had one in here last night, actually.

662
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,367
Oh! How fascinating. I don't suppose you remember where you took him?

663
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,091
- 'Fraid I can't tell you that, love. - Why not?

664
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,369
- It's against the Cabbie's Code, innit? - The what?

665
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,762
The Cabbie's Code! It's an oath of confidentiality we take.

666
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,322
You know, like your doctors, your priests, your medieval knights.

667
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,482
You do understand, don't you, love?

668
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,210
Of course.

669
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,688
Let me tell you about my code.

670
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,810
When somebody doesn't give me what I want, I remove their body parts.

671
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,928
I start with the nasal hair.

672
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,161
Ow.

673
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,208
And then I move on to something juicy.

674
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,004
That's my code and I always stick to it.

675
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,888
Do you always stick to yours?

676
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,122
- Well, it's not even really a code. - No?

677
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,647
It's more a set of guidelines than a binding ethos.

678
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,963
Then tell me, where did you take the bear?

679
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,850
- Windsor Gardens! - Thank you.

680
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,247
I wouldn't go up the Westway this time of night. You wanna go north...

Welcome to the Geographers' Guild. Are you members?

699
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,482
No, but we are looking for one.

700
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,007
- The name? - We don't actually know the name,

701
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,880
but we do know he went on an expedition you funded to Darkest Peru.

702
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,246
Darkest Peru.

703
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,527
- Hmm! - Hmm!

704
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,204
We've never been to Peru.

705
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,884
What? But you must have done.

706
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,885
I can see you're very busy. Perhaps we could just go and check.

707
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,249
There are over two million letters, diaries and artefacts up in our archive,

708
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,800
meticulously filed, and they don't stay that way

709
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,282
by letting strange men and their bears rummage around.

710
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,840
- Listen... - I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

711
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,849
Come on then, Paddington.

712
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:07,161
Paddington?

713
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,561
Paddington?

714
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,402
- Paddington! - Psst! Mr. Brown? In here.

715
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,165
- What are you doing? - We need to get into that archive.

716
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,081
Paddington, please don't take this the wrong way,

717
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,970
but are you certain there was an explorer?

718
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,567
You didn't just find a hat and make up some...

719
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,490
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

720
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,565
Is it me or is it hot in here? Why do I feel so...

721
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,324
- Uncomfortable? - Hmm.

722
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,680
- Flushed? - Hmm.

723
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,444
- Queasy? - Hmm.

724
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,170
It's called a hard stare.

725
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,483
My aunt taught me to do them when people had forgotten their manners.

726
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,803
- Oh, give me strength. - Mr. Brown, you can trust me.

727
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,082
There really was an explorer.

728
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,891
And if we can find him, I know he'll give me a home.

729
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,531
A proper home, like yours.

730
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,370
Now I've got an idea. But I'm going to need your help.

731
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:13,564
- This is never going to work. - Of course it will.

732
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,008
- You look very pretty. - That's what they'll say in jail.

733
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,004
- Morning. - Oh, hello there.

734
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,485
Hold up.

735
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,481
Haven't seen you before, have I?

736
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,201
No, that's right. I'm new.

737
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,567
Hmm... Thought so.

738
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,925
Lovely day, innit?

739
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,331
- Unusually hot. - Yeah.

740
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,201
Just like you.

741
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,005
Go on, then. Off you pop.

742
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,081
Right!

743
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,362
Darkest Peru.

744
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,601
- 200 items! - I knew that lady was hiding something.

745
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,046
What is it?

746
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,727
It says record destroyed. Let's check the others.

747
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,040
Oi!

748
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,884
New girl.

749
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,290
Is there a problem?

750
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,924
- Forgot to check your pass. - My p... Oh, my pass. Yes.

751
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,369
Ah. Oh.

752
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,367
- It's an old photograph. - Ha.

753
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,920
I'm sure you've always been a... Whoa.

754
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,006
0-0-2. Retrieve.

755
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,444
You've changed a bit.

756
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,728
I lost a lot of weight.

757
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,370
You're telling me.

758
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,963
And the...

759
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,126
I had it lasered.

760
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,760
And the arm's grown back.

761
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,011
It's a false arm.

762
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,921
You really can't feel a thing?

763
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,046
Huh.

764
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,970
- Nothing. - Amazing.

765
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,771
Well, I'm just off to the toilet.

766
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,165
See you in a bit.

767
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,004
Mr. Brown, I've found something.

768
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:59,402
That's brilliant. Now let's put these back and get out of here.

769
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,406
- Er... Mr. Brown... - Ah.

770
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,482
Something's jamming the system.

771
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,450
I think it's a baguette. Is that peanut butter?

772
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,887
Too orange. I think it's...

773
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,849
Marmalade.

774
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,840
Hey, you!

775
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,441
Stop that sexy woman!

776
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,371
Halt!

777
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,245
- You have a beautiful home, Mr. Curry. - I've lived here all my life.

778
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,530
I inherited it from my mother. A very distant woman.

779
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,809
And being such a pillar of the community, I can see why

780
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,447
having that beast move in next door would upset you so.

781
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,847
I suppose I should be grateful that it's only one bear.

782
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,003
Oh, but it always starts with just one, Mr. Curry.

783
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,562
Soon, the whole street will be crawling with them.

784
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,802
Drains clogged with fur.

785
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,530
Buns thrown at old ladies.

786
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,968
Raucous all-night picnics.

787
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,963
- What can we do? - I have certain connections.

788
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,726
If I can get hold of the bear, I can see that he's sent where he belongs,

789
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,848
- no questions asked. - Really?

790
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,290
But I can't do it alone. I need a strong, capable man to help me.

791
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:37,806
Me? Oh, now...

792
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,526
If I start hanging around, people will ask questions.

793
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:45,083
But you? You could keep an eye on him, couldn't you? For me?

794
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,251
Of course.

795
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,609
Perfect. So you do that. Soon as he's alone, we'll pounce.

796
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,722
Fire her up, Mr. Gruber.

797
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,246
- You actually broke in? - That's right.

798
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,890
Sounds incredibly brave.

799
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,965
There's a time for being boring and annoying, and a time for being a man.

800
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,010
Mr. Brown dressed up as a lady and someone stuck pins in him.

801
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:09,320
- What? - It's starting.

802
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,004
- What was that? - Doesn't matter.

803
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:12,406
- In a dress? - No!

804
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,686
Did look like a dress.

805
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,406
More of a housecoat. Quite liberating, actually.

806
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,768
Darkest Peru. A vast, unexplored wilderness,

807
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:22,764
shrouded in mystery. Until now!

808
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,928
Is that where you're from?

809
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,970
Oh, Paddington, it's incredible.

810
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,087
Goodbye, Lucy. Goodbye, Pastuzo.

811
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,961
And if you ever make it to London, you can be sure of a very warm welcome.

812
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,122
I have learnt so much from these bears,

813
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,171
but I wonder what, if anything, they have learnt from me.

814
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,042
Montgomery Clyde.

815
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,724
Dear Aunt Lucy. You'll never guess what.

816
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:36,884
Today I saw a film the explorer made of Darkest Peru.

817
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,488
I do miss our old home, although I'm beginning to understand life in London.

818
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,005
The Browns are a curious tribe, but I rather like them.

819
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,606
The way Mr. Brown arranges his stationery.

820
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,045
The strange objects Mrs. Brown finds in her handbag.

821
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:53,963
Ah! There you are.

822
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,283
How Mrs. Bird has a Hoover for every occasion.

823
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,965
That Judy can master any language. Even bear.

824
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,289
Wonderful pronunciation.

825
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:11,283
And how Jonathan can build almost anything

826
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,681
using only Mr. Brown's educational old toys.

827
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,244
This is amazing!

828
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,688
It's very strange. I may be about to find the explorer,

829
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,730
but I'm actually beginning to feel at home here.

830
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,724
Paddington, these books contain the names and addresses

831
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,529
of all the people who live in London.

832
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,331
If we look up every M Clyde, we'll find your explorer.

833
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,971
- Thank you, Mrs. Brown. - Let's get cracking.

834
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,042
Wait for me. I'll see if I can find anything

835
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,849
about Captain Clyde in the library.

836
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,844
I'll come with you. I need to refresh our marmalade supplies.

837
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,287
Shouldn't someone stay with Paddington?

838
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,089
It's only for a few hours.

839
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,562
You don't need to worry, Mr. Brown. I think I've got the hang of things.

840
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,010
Well, you take care.

841
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:52,407
- Bye. - Goodbye.

842
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,642
Have you ever driven one of those?

843
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,247
Yes?

844
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,528
- Yes? - Honeypot, this is Fierce Eagle.

845
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,568
- What? - It's Mr. Curry.

846
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,291
I did suggest that we adopt code names.

847
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,840
- Honeypot and Fierce Eagle. Files, of course.

848
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,491
Do you actually have anything to report, Fierce...?

849
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,965
- Eagle. - ..Eagle?

850
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,087
Affirmative.

851
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:22,448
The Furry Menace is home alone. I repeat,

852
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,166
the Furry Menace is home alone.

853
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,685
I'm on my way.

854
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,281
Honeypot.

855
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,088
- I need to get on the roof. - Yes.

856
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,489
And after, I wondered if you'd like to celebrate by dining with me.

857
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,961
I have some meat-paste sandwiches and pickles.

858
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,202
- Sounds glorious. - They went off on Tuesday

859
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:44,203
but you're normally alright for a week.

860
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,044
Mr. Curry. The roof?

861
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,648
M Clyde, M Clyde...

862
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,766
Oh, dear. Erm...

863
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,091
Erm...

864
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,246
Erm...

865
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,365
I'm coming!

866
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,602
Come on, bear.

867
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:09,249
Just got a bit tied up with the stationery.

868
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,084
Come on, little bear.

869
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,164
Elephant!

870
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,565
Bear!

871
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,288
Hide!

872
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,761
Darling! Darling! Honeypot, I'm coming!

873
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,924
Honeypot! Honeypot!

874
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,409
But it wasn't my fault.

875
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,642
Who else was in the house? The door was locked.

876
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,563
- There was an elephant. - An elephant?

877
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:04,042
It had the head of an elephant and body of a snake, but it tried to shoot me!

878
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,088
- Have you been drinking salt water? - No.

879
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,362
Paddington, tell us what really happened.

880
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,965
- What? - We won't be cross.

881
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:13,562
- Speak for yourself. - Mrs. Brown, you must believe me.

882
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,443
I would never lie to you.

883
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:19,368
I'm sorry, but that was the last straw.

884
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,010
It was an accident. They happen.

885
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,526
- But the children... - Paddington's the best thing

886
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,251
that's ever happened to the children. They're happy.

887
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,164
But what's the point of them being happy if they're not safe?

888
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,651
He's putting them in danger.

889
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,688
They have to be our number-one priority.

890
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,410
They are!

891
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,005
They are.

892
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,962
And the worst part is he won't even tell us the truth.

893
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:49,327
How can he live with us if we can't even trust him?

894
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,243
I don't know, Henry.

895
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,243
We've got to face facts.

896
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:57,009
This house just isn't the place for a bear.

897
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,249
Perhaps you're right.

898
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,651
Maybe we should take him to the authorities.

899
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,884

01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,887

Get out of it!

904
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:55,250

Thank you very much for having me to stay. You are a very lovely family.

909
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,087
I'm very sorry about the flood and the fire...

910
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,521
...and the incident at the Geographers' Guild.

911
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:26,847
I hope that...

912
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,450
...now I have gone, things will calm down a bit.

913
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,043
Yours, Paddington.

914
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,167
Well, shall we go after him?

915
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:42,402
It's better this way.

916
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,809
He didn't really belong here.

917
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,008
How can you say that?

918
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,447
Judy.

919
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,329
I'm going to my room.

920
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,247
- Where are you going? - I just...

921
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,210
I need to know he's OK.

922
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,968
You just don't get it, do you?

923
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,166
What?

924
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:15,201
This family needed that wee bear every bit as much as he needed you.

925
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,801
There. Said my piece.

926
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,125
Hmm...

927
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,243
Excuse me, I'm looking for Montgomery Clyde.

928
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,926
I'm sorry, mate, I'm Morgan Clyde.

929
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,843
Ah. Thank you.

930
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,649
He's about three foot six.

931
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,886
He's got a bright red hat on and a blue duffle coat.

932
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,084
And he's a bear.

933
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,243
It's not much to go on.

934
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,526
Really?

935
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,807
Montgomery Clyde?

936
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,804
I'm Marjorie Clyde, dearie.

937
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:27,563
Still no news.

938
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:30,528
In case you're interested.

939
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,204
Right.

940
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,242
- Who is it? - Hello.

941
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,448
I'm looking for Montgomery Clyde.

942
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,727
- Never heard of him. - But you must have done.

943
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,848
I've tried them all and you're the last...

944
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,207
Why don't you clear off?

945
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:18,168
And if you ever make it to London,

946
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:21,284
you can be sure of a very warm welcome.

947
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,127
Ah!

948
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:39,251
Please, please, please, please...

949
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,162
- Hello?- Hello.

950
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:47,609
- I'm looking for Montgomery Clyde. - Well, that's my father.

951
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,924
- The explorer Montgomery Clyde? - That's right.

952
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,685
Come on in out of the cold. I'll be right down.

953
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,969
Oh. Oh, thank you. Thank you!

954
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,607
Is Captain Clyde at home?

955
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,284
I'm afraid not.

956
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,204
You see, my father is dead.

957
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,531
Oh.

958
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,691
Oh, dear.

959
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,603
What did you want from him?

960
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:19,367
He once told my aunt that if ever we came to London, we'd be welcome.

961
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,880
And I suppose I hoped he might give me a home.

962
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:28,001
Oh, but I can do that.

963
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,811
- You can? - Of course.

964
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,445
A lovely specimen like you shouldn't be out on the streets.

965
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,808
You belong somewhere very special.

966
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,841
And I know just the place.

967
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,126
Come along. We're going for a lovely ride.

968
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:47,970
Miss Clyde!

969
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,847
Mr. Curry. What do you want?

970
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,322
I found these tied to a lamppost and I thought waste not, want not.

971
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:57,449
Channing. Now, if you'll excuse me.

972
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,365
Erm... where exactly are you going?

973
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,128
What concern is it of yours?

974
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,204
- You've got the bear in there. - And?

975
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:11,250
It's just, I thought you were sending him to Peru. But...

976
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,926
I said I was sending him where he belongs,

977
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,606
which in his case is the Natural History Museum.

978
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,448
But, Honeypot, that is barbaric.

979
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,171
Mr. Curry, I am not your Honeypot. I never was.

980
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,486
What?

981
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:27,565
Now take your rotten flowers and get out of here! Go.

982
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,251
Run!

983
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,809
- Hello?- Good evening.

984
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,322
This is an anonymous phone call.

985
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,324
- Oh, hello, Mr. Curry. - It's not Mr. Curry! It's Mr...

986
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,641
..Burry.

987
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,808
I have some news

988
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,531
concerning the bear.

989
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,327
What? What do you mean?

990
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,051
- Who is it, Henry? - It's Mr. Curry doing a silly voice.

991
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,281
It's Burry!

992
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,283
He says Paddington's been kidnapped!

993
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,086
Oh!

994
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,481
Welcome to your new home, bear.

995
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,243
This is a cathedral of knowledge.

996
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,971
Every major explorer has added to its glory.

997
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:38,884
Charles Darwin brought the giant tortoise from the Galapagos.

998
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:39,961
Good evening.

999
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,686
Captain Scott, the emperor penguin from Antarctica.

1000
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,250
- Gentlemen. - Captain Cook,

1001
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:46,408
- the kangaroo from Australia. - G'day.

1002
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,450
Each of these men has been immortalised through his finds.

1003
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,807
But do you see anything from my father?

1004
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:53,245
No.

1005
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,521
Because when he met your oh-so-precious species,

1006
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,841
he refused to collect a specimen.

1007
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,489
No specimen?

1008
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,882
Gentlemen, these were no dumb beasts.

1009
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,962
They were intelligent and civilised.

1010
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:10,566
Come off it, Clyde. They didn't even speak English.

1011
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,728
- Well, no, but... - Did they play cricket?

1012
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,167
- Drink tea? - Do the crossword?

1013
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,846
Pretty rum idea of civilisation you've got, Clyde.

1014
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,720
Tell us their location. We'll send a real explorer to get a specimen.

1015
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,244
Never!

1016
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,488
Very well. You leave me no choice.

1017
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,245
This expedition shall be struck from the records.

1018
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,964
Montgomery Clyde,

1019
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:37,284
I hereby revoke your membership of this hallowed guild.

1020
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,843
Geographers, turn your backs!

1021
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:46,687
He could have been rich and famous,

1022
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:51,243
but instead he threw it all away and he opened a petting zoo.

1023
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,566
He put the happiness of a few furry creatures

1024
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,648
above his own flesh and blood.

1025
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,725
I vowed that one day I would finish the job my father never could.

1026
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,283
And now, at last, that day has come.

1027
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,730
That's right!

1028
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,201
I'm going to stuff you, bear.

1029
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,811
Ow!

1030
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,527
I see him. And there's not a moment to lose!

1031
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,604
How are we going to get in? It'll be locked up like a fortress.

1032
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:54,287
Sewers. Didn't you say they could take you anywhere in the city?

1033
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,600
Brilliant!

1034
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:20,730
You alright, love?

1035
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,167
Would you mind helping a frail old woman?

1036
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,044
I've missed my bus.

1037
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:29,921
- Come on in. Come on out of the cold. - Oh, thank you. You're so kind.

1038
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,001
It's locked from the other side.

1039
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:43,531
Leave it to me.

1040
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,449
What use is my old chemistry set?

1041
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:49,091
- Potassium nitrate, sulphur. - Hmm?

1042
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:50,844
This stuff is lethal, Dad.

1043
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:56,088
Would you like a wee nip of antifreeze for the old pacemaker?

1044
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,287
No, no, no. Not while I'm on duty.

1045
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,443
Oh. Too strong for you, huh?

1046
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,803
Oh. Fighting talk. OK. I'll have one.

1047
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,606
Three, two, one.

1048
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:26,689
- Jonathan! That's 50,000 volts of... - I know what I'm doing!

1049
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,081
Go for it!

1050
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,446
Go!

1051
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:48,691
No, best of three. I wasn't ready. Come on.

1052
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,650
It's locked.

1053
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:16,166
- What do we do now? - I know.

1054
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,167
- Henry! Henry, do not go out there! - Do it, Dad.

1055
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,206
Someone has to.

1056
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,002
And that someone is me.

1057
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,730
Oh, I say!

1058
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,484
My hero.

1059
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,280
Crikey.

1060
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,210
Oh!

1061
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,611
Whoa!

1062
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,608
Actually, this is insane.

1063
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,763
- Dad is properly cool. - He certainly is.

1064
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:19,647
I give up. I've gotta get back to work.

1065
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,760
Look, wait, wait, wait.

1066
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,770
Where's your fighting spirit?

1067
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,360
Henry!

1068
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:50,768
Dad!

1069
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,481
Thank you.

1070
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,891
He's alright.

1071
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,689
Good dog. Mwah!

1072
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,131
Paddington!

1073
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,606
Paddington!

1074
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:12,682
Up here!

1075
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,328
Is that you, God?

1076
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,686
What?

1077
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,684
It's just you sound a lot more like Mr. Brown than I imagined.

1078
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,564
It is Mr. Brown.

1079
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:25,325
Mr. Brown! What are you doing out there?

1080
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,004
We've come to rescue you!

1081
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,411
You have?

1082
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:32,650
Mr. Curry explained everything. I'm so sorry I didn't believe you.

1083
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:39,208
Sabotage.

1084
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,767
Paddington, get out of there!

1085
01:18:58,680 --> 01:18:59,761
Bear!

1086
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:23,404
Give up, bear!

1087
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,281
Give up, bear!

1088
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,604
There's no way out.

1089
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:10,285
Henry!

1090
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,963
- Where's Paddington? - I don't know.

1091
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,771
Shh. I can hear something.

1092
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,164
- That's just the pipes. - That's not pipes. That's bear.

1093
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,127
- He's going for the roof. - Come on!

1094
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,765
Upstairs.

1095
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:19,161
- We've got you. - Thank you.

1096
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,489
Come on, let's get out of here.

1097
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:28,005
- Not so fast. - No!

1098
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,731
Come on, hand over the bear.

1099
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,205
No. We won't do that.

1100
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,203
Mrs. Brown?

1101
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,408
- He's family. - Family?

1102
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,608
You're not even the same species.

1103
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,289
It's true.

1104
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,408
It is true.

1105
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,802
And when I first met Paddington, I wanted nothing to do with him.

1106
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:54,684
But my wonderful wife, she opened her heart to him

1107
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,286
and so did my incredible children.

1108
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,362
- And now I have, too. - Henry...

1109
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,603
it doesn't matter that he comes from the other side of the world

1110
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:04,927
or that he's a different species

1111
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,651
or that he has a worrying marmalade habit.

1112
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,765
We love Paddington. And that makes him family!

1113
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,081
And families stick together!

1114
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:18,609
So if you want him, you'll have to take us all!

1115
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:19,920
OK, then.

1116
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,207
When I say all...

1117
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:25,568
- I've never stuffed a human, but... - Wait.

1118
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,404
Wait.

1119
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:30,131
- You don't need to do that. - Paddington!

1120
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,089
- No! - Yes.

1121
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,322
That's right. Come, come.

1122
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,968
Erm, could I have one last request?

1123
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,327
What is it?

1124
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,250
I'd like a sandwich. There's one in my hat.

1125
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:51,046
Go on, then.

1126
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:53,366
Thank you.

1127
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,363
Whoa!

1128
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,930
Who-o-oa!

1129
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,848
Nice try, bear!

1130
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,480
The crow's nest!

1131
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,085
Mrs. Bird.

1132
01:23:22,160 --> 01:23:23,366
What?

1133
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,649
Hey, why didn't you look where you were going?

1134
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:28,802
Ah, shut your piehole.

1135
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:34,003
- Mrs. Bird, you saved me. - Oh!

1136
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,287
- Paddington! - A bear.

1137
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,928
Go easy. I have a dreadful headache.

1138
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,006
Hello?

1139
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,401
- Hi, Dad. - Hello, Mr. Brown.

1140
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,649
- Hello. - What's going on?

1141
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:10,884
What a lovely surprise. I didn't expect you home so early.

1142
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,804
- Something special's going on. - More sugar.

1143
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,724
- Look at this. Hello, everyone. - Hi, Dad.

1144
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,610
- Hi, big fella. What's cooking? - Marmalade, Mr. Brown.

1145
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:24,126
- Go on, have a taste. - Hmm, delicious.

1146
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,965
Just one sandwich contains all the vitamins and minerals

1147
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,570
a bear needs for the whole day.

1148
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:31,007
So does that mean I don't have to eat vegetables?

1149
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:33,447
- He said bear, not boy. - Sorry, Jonathan.

1150
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:35,124
- Thank you, Judy. - Judy.

1151
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:38,841
Now, has anyone seen... Ah, thank you, Mrs. Bird.

1152
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:41,127
I think every home should have a marmalade day.

1153
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,931
- And a bear. - Especially a bear.

1154
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,411
Home.

1155
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,244
Dear Aunt Lucy.

1156
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,688
I'm sorry I haven't written sooner but so much has been happening.

1157
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,808
I even met the explorer's daughter,

1158
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,646
but she tried to stuff me, so Mrs. Bird threw her off a roof.

1159
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,846
Millicent Clyde...

1160
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,571
The judge didn't think that prison would do her any good.

1161
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,802
So instead, he gave her community service...

1162
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,406
No, please! Anything! Anything but that!

1163
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:11,084
...in the petting zoo.

1164
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:17,051
- Get a move on, dung breath! - It's not my breath!

1165
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:24,845
Back in Windsor Gardens, life is very different.

1166
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,890
Mrs. Bird says it's because things are finally set fair

1167
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,248
and it's had a tremendous effect on her knees.

1168
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:35,211
Judy's embarrassment is clearing up and she's even let Mrs. Brown meet Tony.

1169
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:37,442
- You can't say anything. - Of course not.

1170
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,171
- You can't touch me. - I won't touch anyone, darling.

1171
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:42,931
- And you're not gonna cry. - No! No.

1172
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,526
There's just a lot going on in my heart right now.

1173
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,967
We process things very differently, you and I.

1174
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,730
- I know. - Good.

1175
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:53,003
Mum, this is Tony.

1176
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,686
- Welcome to the family. - Oh. Mum!

1177
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,650
Sorry. Sorry. Not crying.

1178
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,441
Henry?

1179
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:04,249
I'm sorry about her.

1180
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,043
She's weird. Er, but we all are.

1181
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:12,126
Tea, anyone? No? No.

1182
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,841
And Mr. Brown is helping Jonathan build an enormous rocket.

1183
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,285
Are you sure about this, Dad?

1184
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,721
If we're gonna get this bad boy into orbit,

1185
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,848
we're gonna need all the nitroglycerin.

1186
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:25,720
Although Jonathan worries about his father's reckless attitude to safety.

1187
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:27,882
Houston, we may have a problem.

1188
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:29,166
Duck!

1189
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:37,360
Mrs. Brown says that in London, everyone is different,

1190
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:40,523
but that means anyone can fit in.

1191
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,210
I think she must be right,

1192
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:46,490
because although I don't look like anyone else, I really do feel at home.

1193
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:51,201
I will never be like other people, but that's alright.

1194
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,964
Because I am a bear.

1195
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,886
A bear called Paddington.

1196
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:58,443
